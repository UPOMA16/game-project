Doodle Game (C++ and SFML)
A simple Doodle Jump game where the player jumps on platforms, climbs higher and avoids falling. The game requires Microsoft Visual Studio, SFML 2.5 or higher, Windows, and a C++ compiler. To run the game, include the SFML libraries (sfml-graphics-d.lib, sfml-window-d.lib, sfml-system-d.lib) and copy all .dll files from the SFML/bin/ folder into the Debug folder. The Images/ folder and font file must be placed inside the game folder. Gaming controls are: the left and right arrows move the character and pressing R restarts after a game over. The character jumps automatically.
For setting SFML in Visual Studio, download SFML 2.5.1 and extract it. Create a folder for the game, place all C++ files there and add the extracted SFML folder inside the project. In the Visual Stdio, install the C/C++ extension, set the include path to SFML/include, the library path to SFML/lib and link the libraries sfml-graphics, sfml-window and sfml-system. Finally, copy all .dll files from SFML/bin/ into the same folder as the executable, so the game runs correctly.
